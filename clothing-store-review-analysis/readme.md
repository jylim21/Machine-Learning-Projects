## THE PROJECT

The dataset used here is the [Loan Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/loan-dataset) by *ALLENA VENKATA SAI ABY*, the free version allows users to export daily data on temperature, humidity, wind, solar, and precipitation etc. for different location with a daily limit of 1000 rows. Since this dataset contains data from July 2016 to Dec 2023, it took me 3 days to get the data required.

It consists of a portfolio of approved loans which were either Fully Paid, Charged Off, or still ongoing (current) with no certain outcome. Our objective is to predict the outcomes of these current loans which would give the Loan Commissioner a probabilistic estimate of recoveries on the current portfolio, and hopefully, a way to screen borrowers based on their initial details.
